Requirements:
[ImageMagick 7](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) (ImageMagick-7.1.0-48-Q16-HDRI-x64-dll.exe is the download that I've used.)

- QuickDither - Crunches input files without any additional button presses. Very quick, but you need to modify the bat to get it just right.

- WebDither - Will ask questions to better treat images. Good if there's specific details that are needed.
