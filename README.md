Howdy! This is a repository of all the lil' tools that I've made to help myself with art projects. There are more readme files in each of the folders. The repository can be downloaded [like so](https://github.com/WondaMegapon/art-tools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to easily access any of the tools.

Note: You still have to download each tool's dependencies, like [ImageMagick 7](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php).
