# Generate sitelen pona
This program generates a folder filled with individual sitelen pona images. Useful for me, I don't know how useful it is for you.
## Usage
### Generate Folder
By running the program, it will generate an `output` folder containing all of the sitelen pona that's specified in `input.txt`.

### Changing Input
The input can be modified through the `input.txt` file. Each line is an individual image.

### Changing Font
Since the program reads from `font.otf`, replacing it with another `.otf` file will alter the font accordingly.
